# YouTubeDataHarvesting
YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL, MongoDB and Streamlit
These import statements suggest that the code may involve working with Google APIs, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, regular expressions, Streamlit for creating a web application or dashboard, and data manipulation with JSON and pandas. The code itself likely contains further functionality related to these libraries and modules.

A function is created to connect the API platform to fetch YouTube data as we require.
Channel ID is given as input in the function and the details required are fetched correspondingly.
